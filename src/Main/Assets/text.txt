n.Nine Stone Puzzle - A Visionary tells you about a certain shopkeeper has nine stones that look absolutely identical. He explains that one stone is actually an extremely valuable gem while the other eight are worthless baubles. The worthless eight are exactly the same while the valuable gem is slightly and imperceivably heavier. Each stone costs $9 to buy and you only have $27 to spend.  The shopkeeper will allow you to use a very precise equal-arm scale charging $9 for each measurement. This equal-arm scale only tells you what side of the balance is heavier than the other. You can put any number of stones on either side to weigh. Can you find the gem?
