n.Tigers and True Love - You must use boolean logic to choose the correct door that will free your true lovers. Be advised, a wrong door could lead to a hungry, angry tiger!
n.Nine Stone Puzzle - A Visionary tells you that a certain shopkeeper has nine stones which look absolutely identical but that one stone is actually an extremely valuable gem while the other eight are worthless baubles. The worthless eight are exactly the same. But the valuable gem is just slightly (and imperceivably) heavier. Each stone costs nine dollars but you only have 27 dollars.
                      The shopkeeper will also allow you to use a very precise equal-arm balance but each measurement costs nine dollars. This equal-arm balance only tells you that one side of the balance is heavier than the other. One can put any number of objects on either side of the balance.
