Based on the statements below each door and the statements of the jailer (who may or may not be lying), you must choose the door(s) you believe has a lover behind it. Find a lover every turn and you can ecape the dungeon! Click on the doors to open them or click on the "I choose Neither!" button to choose neither. You will receive a point for every lover found (if no tiger found first) and bonus points if you find both lovers during a trial.

Behind each door I have placed either a hungry tiger or one of your true loves. Tigers or true loves could also be behind both doors. On each door is a sign that is either true or false. The only concesson I have made is that the signs on the doors are consistent with what is behind the doors! During every trial you may pick one, both or neither doors!
